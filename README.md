# FAQ
Q: Why does this exist?
A: I finally made a useful program. Use it, or don't.


Q: Well, are you going to make it better?
A: Yes and no. I always want this to be a simple CLI tool, but there's always room for improvement. I will actively maintain this repo, but you can modify this program as you see fit! I encourage you to make your own flavor of PyCash if that's something you want to do.

Q: It doesn't work. What do I do?
A: Please report any bugs you find! I'm not some hotshot developer, so I expect this thing to break. Have fun!
